Introduction:
RAG is an AI framework that improves the accuracy and reliability of large language models (LLMs) by grounding them in external knowledge bases.
LLMs can be inconsistent and prone to errors, lacking true understanding of word meaning.
RAG addresses these issues by providing access to up-to-date facts and verifiable sources, increasing user trust.

Purpose of RAG:
Grounding LLMs on external knowledge for improved responses.

Overcoming inconsistencies in LLM-generated answers.

Challenges Addressed by RAG:
Inconsistency in LLM responses.

Lack of understanding of the meaning of words by LLMs.

Reduction of opportunities for the model to leak sensitive data.

Benefits of RAG:
Accuracy and Fact-Checking:
Ensures LLM responses are based on reliable sources, allowing users to verify claims.

Reduced Bias and Hallucination:
Limits LLM reliance on internal biases and prevents fabrication of information.

Lower Cost and Maintenance:
Reduces the need for continuous LLM retraining and updates, saving computational resources.

How RAG Works:
RAG consists of two distinct phases: retrieval and content generation.

In the retrieval phase, algorithms search for and retrieve relevant information from external knowledge bases.
This information is then used in the generative phase, where the LLM synthesizes an answer based on both the augmented prompt and its internal representation of training data.

Phase 1: Retrieval
Relevant information is retrieved from external sources based on the user's prompt or question.

Sources vary depending on the context (open-domain internet vs. closed-domain enterprise data).

Phase 2: Content Generation
The retrieved information is appended to the user's prompt and fed to the LLM.

The LLM generates a personalized answer based on the augmented prompt and its internal knowledge base.

The answer can be delivered with links to its sources for transparency.

Advantages and Applications of RAG
RAG offers several advantages, including access to the latest, reliable facts, reduction in sensitive data leakage and decreased need for continuous model retraining.
It finds applications in personalized responses, verifiable answers and lowering computational and financial costs in enterprise settings.

Access to current and reliable information.

Reduced opportunities for sensitive data leakage.

Lower computational and financial costs in LLM-powered applications.
